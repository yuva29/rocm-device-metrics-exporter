# List of Available AINIC Metrics

This section provides an overview of the AINIC statistics available, based on the environment where the device metrics exporter is running: BareMetal, Hypervisor, or Virtual Machine (VM).

In a typical deployment where:

* AINIC Physical Function (PF) interfaces reside on the baremetal or hypervisor.
* AINIC Virtual Function (VF) interfaces are assigned to guest VMs.

## Exporter Running on BareMetal / Hypervisor

When the metrics exporter runs on the host system, it can collect the following metrics:

* AINIC Port statistics
* PF interfaces: LIF, Queue Pair, RDMA & Ethtool statistics
* VF interfaces: LIF & Queue Pair statistics

## Exporter Running Inside a VM

When the metrics exporter runs inside a guest VM, the following metrics are available:

* VF interfaces: RDMA & Ethtool stats

## Supported AINIC metrics list

The following table contains a full list of AINIC Metrics that are available using the Device Metrics Exporter.
